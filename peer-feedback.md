# Peer Review & Group Feedback

## Feedback received

The feedback I received from my group was generally positive and focused on strengthening what was already there rather than fixing major issues. People felt that my draft clearly explained the overall idea of using live alarms in XR and showed how the PLC, Node‑RED, and Unity parts fit together. The main suggestions were to make my Unity work even more visible by adding more screenshots and short clips, and to tie my reflection more clearly to specific sprints and milestones instead of talking only in general terms.

## My response to feedback

I decided to keep the structure and tone of my original draft, because it already represented my role well, but I expanded the evidence around it. I added more concrete examples of my Unity contributions (HUD states, data link, animations) and attached supporting images and videos in the Contributions section. I also updated the Reflection page so that it refers directly to moments like the first data on HoloLens, the HUD coming together, and the final polish sprint. This let me respond to the feedback without losing my own voice or rewriting the portfolio from scratch.
