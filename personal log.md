### Personal sprint log

**Sprint 1 (planning & setup)**  
I supported Laheeq with the initial Node‑RED setup and then focused on management and planning while my main tasks were in Unity.[conversation_history:1] I began exploring Unity XR environments, sketched the full data‑to‑visual pipeline, and drafted how C# scripts would drive UI and animations.[conversation_history:1]

**Sprint 2 (error variables & data layer)**  
I helped the team identify and document the many SIF‑401 error and status variables that would later control alarms in Unity.[conversation_history:1] We also set up InfluxDB so time‑series data from the cell could be stored and later visualised.[conversation_history:1]

**Sprint 3 (logic, placeholders, early UI)**  
I worked with the others to extend the Node‑RED logic and connected it to placeholder Unity animations representing the loaders and alarms.[conversation_history:1] In Unity I built an early, rough XR UI to show key process values and basic alarm states.[conversation_history:1]

**Sprint 4 (data connection & polishing)**  
My focus moved to wiring live data into the Unity scene so that UI tiles and alarm panels updated from the backend instead of test values.[conversation_history:1] I refined the layout of the XR panels and adjusted animations so they matched the physical behaviour of the SIF‑401 cell more closely.[conversation_history:1]

**Sprint 5 (refactor, testing, documentation)**  
I refactored the XR UI for consistency, improved naming and hierarchy in the Unity project, and helped run full end‑to‑end tests from Node‑RED through to the XR visualisation.[conversation_history:1] I also documented how the UI, alarms, and loaders work together so future developers can reuse the setup.[conversation_history:1]
